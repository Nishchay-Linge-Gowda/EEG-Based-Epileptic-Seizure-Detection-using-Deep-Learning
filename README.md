# EEG-Based Epileptic Seizure Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
The **EEG-Based Epileptic Seizure Detection using Deep Learning** project focuses on building a classification model capable of detecting epileptic seizures from **Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals**.  
EEG data provides insights into brain activity, and accurate analysis of these signals is crucial for **neurological research and medical diagnostics** — especially for identifying epilepsy and related disorders.  

This project integrates **signal processing**, **feature extraction**, and **machine learning / deep learning** techniques to classify EEG recordings as **seizure** or **non-seizure** events using the **CHB-MIT** and **Bonn EEG datasets**.  

---

## Objectives
- Develop a **robust classification model** for EEG signal analysis.  
- Apply **feature extraction** techniques (e.g., Recurrence Quantification Analysis, Recurrence Network Features).  
- Implement **CNN** or **RNN-based deep learning models** to detect seizure patterns.  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Visualize EEG signals, training progress, and model predictions for better interpretability.

## Datasets

### 1. **CHB-MIT EEG Database**
- Contains EEG recordings from **epileptic patients**.  
- Includes multiple seizure and non-seizure recordings.  
- Widely used in research for seizure prediction and classification.  

### 2. **Bonn EEG Dataset**
- Focused on EEG signals representing **epileptic and healthy brain activity**.  
- Organized into subsets for seizure, non-seizure, and interictal (between seizures) conditions.  

Both datasets are publicly available for research and are used here for **training, validation, and testing** of EEG classifiers.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Download and extract** both CHB-MIT and Bonn datasets.  
- **Inspect data** to understand structure, sampling frequency, and labeling.  
- **Handle missing or noisy data** using filtering (e.g., band-pass filter) and signal smoothing.  
- **Normalize and resample** signals for uniformity.  
- **Augment data** (e.g., window slicing, flipping, or noise injection) to enhance diversity.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Extract statistical and nonlinear features from EEG signals:
  - **Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA):** Measures signal complexity, determinism, and entropy.  
  - **Recurrence Network Features:** Captures dynamic relationships between EEG states.  
- Convert time-series signals into 2D representations (e.g., spectrograms) for CNN input.

### 3. Data Splitting
- Split datasets into:
  - **Training Set (70%)**
  - **Validation Set (15%)**
  - **Test Set (15%)**  
- Ensure **balanced representation** of seizure and non-seizure samples.

### 4. Model Selection
- Select and implement appropriate model architectures:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – for spatial feature extraction from EEG spectrograms.  
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / LSTM** – for capturing temporal dependencies in EEG signals.  
- Experiment with hybrid CNN-RNN architectures for enhanced performance.

### 5. Model Training
- Train the model using **cross-entropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  
- Apply **regularization techniques** such as dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping.  
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** (learning rate, batch size, layers, etc.) for optimization.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model using key metrics:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **ROC-AUC Curve**
- Use the **validation set** for iterative improvement and tuning.

### 7. Testing
- Assess final model performance on the **unseen test set**.  
- Verify model generalization and reliability using confusion matrix and classification reports.

### 8. Results & Visualization
- Plot:
  - Raw EEG signals and filtered signals.  
  - Training and validation loss/accuracy curves.  
  - ROC curves for model performance.  
  - Feature heatmaps and seizure detection results.  
- Visualize **seizure vs. non-seizure** classifications for selected EEG samples.

### 9. Reporting
Include a detailed report with:
- **Introduction and background** on EEG and epilepsy.  
- **Data preprocessing and feature extraction** methods.  
- **Model architecture and hyperparameters.**  
- **Evaluation metrics, results, and comparison.**  
- **Discussion and future work** (e.g., real-time seizure prediction systems).
